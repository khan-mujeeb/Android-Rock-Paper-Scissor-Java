## How to play
In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose one of three hand signs
- Rock
- Paper 
- Scissor

### rock (made by making a fist)

### paper (made by laying your hand flat)

### scissors (made by holding out two fingers to look like scissors)

## Rules
- Both players show their signs at the same time to see who will win
- Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another:  
  * Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)
  * Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)
  * Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper)
